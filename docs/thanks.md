# Thanks

Inspired by the conecpt of [Adam Seckel](https://github.com/hemlok) and [spring-keyframes](https://github.com/hemlok/spring-keyframes) - a framework agnostic library for generating keyframes for physics based animations.

Also heavily inspired by [React-Motion](https://github.com/chenglou/react-motion) with the bulk of the physics logic originally done by [Cheng Lou](https://github.com/chenglou).
